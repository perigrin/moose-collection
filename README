Moose Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This project is a git 'superproject' for Free Moose components
available via git.

Until it is known that git's submodule support handles it well,
projects will never be renamed/moved.

In general there will not be a new superproject commit for every
submodule commit; if you want the very latest from each of the
submodules you will have to pull them individually.  However, the
following branches will be defined;

  - stable - representing only CPAN released versions of modules
  - dev - representing CPAN development releases
  - next - collecting 'master'-quality branches from sub-projects
           where available, or latest CPAN release where not.
  - pu - collecting 'trunk'-quality branches

'next' and 'pu' will be subject to automatic update, probably on an
hourly or thereabouts basis.  'stable' and 'dev' will be updated as
new already added CPAN releases are noticed, or as signed tags in
subprojects are noticed.

Instructions and helper scripts will follow, but for now you'll have
to spend the few minutes it takes to learn how git submodules work;
note if you don't understand the DESCRIPTION part of a recent
git-submodule(1), I recommend first the git user manual section on
"git concepts".  eg
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#git-concepts

If you would like your own free Moose project considered for
inclusion, please send through a patch to this superproject which adds
it.  You can send them to the Moose user's list;

    The mailing list is moose@perl.org. You must be
    subscribed to send a message. To subscribe, send an
    empty message to moose-subscribe@perl.org

Enjoy!
Sam Vilain, evil Moose Conspirator, wing commander of sideline sniping
squadron.
